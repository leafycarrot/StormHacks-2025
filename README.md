# StormHacks 2025 - Angular Project

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.4.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Angular CLI (`npm install -g @angular/cli`)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leafycarrot/StormHacks-2025.git
   cd StormHacks-2025
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will create the `node_modules/` folder with all required packages.

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```
   This will automatically create the `.angular/` cache folder and start the server.

4. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to view the application.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
